## Dependencies

For this program to run successfully, the following libraries and their
dependencies *must* be installed:

⋅⋅* tqdm
⋅⋅* scikit-learn
⋅⋅* keras
⋅⋅* tensorflow
⋅⋅* gensim
⋅⋅* bokeh

## Run options

The main method is located in Parser.py -- the optional runtime arguments are
shown below:

⋅⋅* '-v': verbose. Provides more output. Can be called again to provide even more
      runtime information ('-v -v')

⋅⋅* '-w2vGraph': Creates and displays the w2v word map -- interactive HTML map.

Ideally, if the user has all of the requirements outlined above, they should be
able to run the program with the following:

'''
python Parser.py
'''

## word2vec word map
The wordmap has already been created as a '.html' file -- in the case that you
do not want to run -w2vGraph (it takes a while), the result .html can be seen in
'Parser.html'.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you for your hard work at grading my stuff for the semester. I really
appreciate the work that you have done, and I hope you have a lovely break!
